Although PowerShell has been around for 10 years now, there are still some who are just getting started with it. There are several categories that new comers fit into, some are just starting out in their career, others may be career changers, and others may have been in the industry for a number of years and are finally trying to embrace PowerShell.

Regardless of which category you fit into, I'll be presenting a session on "<em><a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/515/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=50038" target="_blank">PowerShell Fundamentals for the Absolute Beginner</a></em>" at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/515/EventHome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #515 in Baton Rouge</a> this Saturday, August 6th. This beginner session begins at 9:15am in room 1835 at the <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/Portals/1018/Business%20School%20SQL%20Saturday-1.png" target="_blank">LSU Business Education Complex</a>.

I'll also be presenting a session on "<em><a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/515/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=50041" target="_blank">PowerShell Desired State Configuration from the Trenches</a></em>" on the same day and at the same event (<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/515/EventHome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #515 in Baton Rouge</a>). That particular intermediate level session begins at 12:15pm in the same room (1835).

If you're attending this event to learn PowerShell, then you'll want to be in room 1835 all day since it's a full day dedicated track for PowerShell. As always, be sure to check <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/515/Sessions/Schedule.aspx" target="_blank">the event schedule</a> for any session changes.

The slide deck and demo code for both of my presentations will be posted in <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank">my presentations repository on GitHub</a> prior to my sessions.
