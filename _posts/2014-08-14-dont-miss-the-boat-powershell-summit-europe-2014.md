If you’re a frequent reader of the articles on this blog site then you probably already know that the information I write about is based on my real world experiences and the same holds true for this blog article about the PowerShell Summit conferences.

During the past two years (since its inception), I have attended the PowerShell Summit North America and I can say without doubt that attending those conferences has definitely helped to advance my career. While anyone can pay the fee and attend, it’s the ideas that are sparked by learning from and networking with other PowerShell enthusiasts, experts, MVP’s, and team members that you take back with you to your environment and build upon that really makes attending these events worthwhile.

<em>“A smart man makes a mistake, learns from it, and never makes that mistake again. But a wise man finds a smart man and learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.”</em> - Roy H. Williams

I've attended more conferences and training than I can count during my 20+ year career as an IT Pro. Based on my experiences, if I could only attend one conference a year regardless of price and location, it would be the PowerShell Summit because of the expertise level of the speakers and the real world content that they present.

The PowerShell Summit conferences are also very cost effective from a return on investment standpoint because <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/" target="_blank">PowerShell.org</a> who hosts these conferences isn't trying to make a profit, they’re only trying to cover expenses. I have generally found that the cost for everything including the conference ticket, hotel, and travel is less than the cost for the ticket alone to attend some of the larger conferences that I've attended in the past.

There have been many people who live outside of North America that have attended the PowerShell Summit North America during the past two years. During that time, I've also seen an overwhelming amount of requests and comments about wanting a similar type of event in Europe. For all of you who asked for it, 2014 is your lucky year but don't miss the boat because you have less than 60 days left to register for the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit Europe 2014</a>. The conference itself is being held in Amsterdam September 29<sup>th</sup> through October 1<sup>st</sup> 2014.

What does <em>"Don't miss the boat"</em> mean? <em>It means “to miss out or not take advantage of something that would lead to success”.</em>

If you work in a Microsoft shop, then I’m sure you’re aware that they’re heavily investing in PowerShell and if you don’t take the time to learn it or learn it better, someone else will.
