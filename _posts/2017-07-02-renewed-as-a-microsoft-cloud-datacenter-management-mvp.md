I'm honored and humbled to have been awarded <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Microsoft MVP award</a> for a fourth consecutive year. I received email notification yesterday confirming that I've been renewed for another year. The first two Microsoft MVP awards that I received were for PowerShell and due to changes to Microsoft's MVP award program, the latest two have been for Cloud and Datacenter Management, although my focus is still PowerShell.

In addition to being a multiyear recipient of the Microsoft MVP award, I'm also a multiyear recipient of <a href="https://www.sapien.com/company/mvp/10/Mike_Robbins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the SAPIEN Technologies MVP</a> award.
