Maybe money's tight this year and you're unable to attend a conference or maybe you've already gone through your training budget for the year. There's another way to attend that conference this year for little cost and what better technology than PowerShell to attend a conference on, all while supporting a great cause (<a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/" target="_blank">Save the Children</a>).

<a href="http://manning.com/hicks/"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7744" alt="powershelldeepdives_cover150" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/powershelldeepdives_cover150.jpg?w=120" width="120" height="150" /></a>This isn't your ordinary PowerShell book. The <a href="http://manning.com/hicks/" target="_blank">PowerShell Deep Dives</a> book is designed to be like "A conference in a book" and contains 28 chapters divided up into four different sections (PowerShell Administration, PowerShell Scripting, PowerShell for Developers, and PowerShell Platforms). The chapters are written by a couple of dozen different authors who are PowerShell experts, many of which are PowerShell MVP's.

As an added bonus, today only, you can receive 50% off the price of the PowerShell Deep Dives book by using promo code dotd0725tw.
