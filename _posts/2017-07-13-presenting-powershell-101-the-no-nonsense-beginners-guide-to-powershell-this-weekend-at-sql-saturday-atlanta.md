If you're interested in some free PowerShell training where you'll learn the basics of PowerShell from a best practices standpoint, I'll be presenting a session on "<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/652/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=64725" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a>" at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/652/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQL Saturday #652</a> in Atlanta, Georgia this Saturday, July 15th.

My presentation begins at 8am eastern time and is a beginner level session. There's also a <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/652/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=64459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powering Azure from PowerShell</a> session that Microsoft MVP <a href="https://twitter.com/arcanecode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Cain</a> is presenting at 2:15pm.

Here’s a little information about what you can expect from my session:

<strong>PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</strong>
<em>Interested in PowerShell but not sure how to get started? Already have some experience but still having trouble with the basic concepts? This session is for you! Learn to easily figure out what the commands are and how to use those commands without searching the Internet. Extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server. During this presentation, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate several of the core PowerShell cmdlets along with writing one-liners and basics scripts. We’ll discuss how to prevent resume generating events when making changes with PowerShell. Learn what objects, properties, and methods are along with how they’re used in PowerShell. Not a developer? PowerShell is one of those technologies that you can be extremely effective with whether you’re a developer or an IT Pro.</em>

My session will be located in room 1107 at Gwinnett Technical College. The address is 5150 Sugarloaf Parkway Bldg 900, Atlanta, Georgia, 30043 (USA). Be sure to check <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/652/Sessions/Schedule.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the event schedule</a> for any last minute changes.

The PowerShell code used during my demonstrations and the slide deck from my session will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.

I hope to see you there!
