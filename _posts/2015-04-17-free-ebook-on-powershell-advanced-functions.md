Recently, a team of independent bloggers who are active in the PowerShell community teamed up to bring you a series of blog articles on advanced functions via an experiment called PowerShell blog week.

Those blog articles have now been complied into a free eBook and are downloadable in all of the popular eBook formats. A zip file containing the PDF, MOBI, EPUB, and AZW3 formats can be downloaded from <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/PSBlogWeek-AdvancedFunctions.zip">here</a>.
