Got no training budget? This Saturday, September 30th, is your opportunity to show some initiative by leveling up your skills on your own time and at your own expense (it's free) at <a href="http://gulfcoastcodecamp.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gulf Coast Code Camp 2017</a>. The venue is at the University of South Alabama and features 16 speakers who are experts in the technology space.

While I can't speak for everyone else who is presenting, my session begins at 9:40am central time where you'll learn the industry's best practices for PowerShell Toolmaking with Advanced Functions and Script Modules from a previous winner of the advanced category in the scripting games who is also a multiyear recipient of both Microsoft's and SAPIEN Technologies MVP award.

Here’s a little information about what you can expect from my session:

<em>Transitioning from writing PowerShell one-liners and basic scripts to creating reusable PowerShell tools with advanced functions and script modules can be a daunting task and with all the different ways that you’ll find on the Internet to accomplish the same task, it can definitely seem overwhelming. During this session, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demystify many of the intricacies of toolmaking while demonstrating the best practices for using parameters, parameter validation, cmdlet binding, supports should process, pipeline input, error handling, module manifests, and custom formatting. This session will NOT be a deep dive into any one of the previously listed topics. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.</em>

All code shown during this presentation will be made available in <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.
