I received notification last Friday, July 1st that I've been renewed for another year as a <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000891" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a>. This is my third MVP award, two as a PowerShell MVP and now one as a Cloud and Datacenter MVP.

Although I'm now considered a Cloud and Datacenter MVP due to the changes to the Microsoft's MVP program, my focus is still PowerShell. I look forward to seeing my fellow MVP's at the MVP Summit again later this year.

In addition to being a multiyear recipient of the Microsoft MVP award, I'm also a multiyear recipient of the <a href="http://www.sapien.com/company/mvp/10/Mike_Robbins" target="_blank">SAPIEN Technologies MVP</a> award.
