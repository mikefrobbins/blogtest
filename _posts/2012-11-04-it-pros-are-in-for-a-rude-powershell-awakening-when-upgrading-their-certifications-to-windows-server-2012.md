I've had a lot of irons in the fire this year and haven't had time to dedicate to taking any certification tests year to date. This year, I've spent much of the time that I would have normally spent studying for certification tests, learning PowerShell instead.

I competed in the Scripting Games earlier in the year. I finished in third place in the beginner class and lead the beginner class for more than half of the games:

I attended several technology events as I normally do each year, but this year I sat through as many PowerShell sessions as possible and I even sat through some of the same PowerShell sessions twice when they were repeated at these events:

Microsoft TechEd in Orlando
SharePoint Saturday in New Orleans
SQL Saturday in Atlanta
SQL Saturday in Birmingham
SQL Saturday in Baton Rouge
PowerShell Saturday in Charlotte
PowerShell Saturday in Atlanta (I presented a PowerShell session for beginners)

I listen to the <a href="http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">PowerScripting podcast</a> live on Thursday nights whenever possible and while traveling (driving) to several of the events that I listed above, I've listened to hours upon hours of previous episodes of the PowerScripting podcast that took place before I started listening to them live. Nothing like multitasking. More on learning PowerShell while multitasking in a future blog.

I read several PowerShell books this year and even wrote a chapter in a <a href="http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2012/08/powershell-deep-dive-book-project/" target="_blank">PowerShell Deep Dive book</a> that will be published next year. I wrote numerous blog articles about PowerShell on my blog site, as a guest blogger on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/10/25/powershell-fundamentals-for-beginners.aspx" target="_blank">Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog</a>, and for <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2012/06/27/mike-f-robbinss-favorite-powershell-tips-tricks/" target="_blank">PowerShell Magazine</a>.

I kind of felt that I had been a slacker when it comes to certifications this year since I have the opportunity to take one test each calendar year at no out of pocket expense and I haven't taken advantage of that benefit this year. With less than two months left before the end of the year, I started searching for a test to take and finally decided on the 70-417 test to upgrade my MCSA: Windows Server 2008 to MCSA: Windows Server 2012.

I used a voucher from <a href="http://oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a> books for a free ebook that I received at one of the technology events I attended this year to purchased the only book available for that test which is currently a pre-release book:

<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145369666.do" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-5699" title="exam-ref70-417" alt="" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/exam-ref70-417.jpg?w=122" height="150" width="122" /></a>

I started reading this book two nights ago and in chapter 1, page 2, what do I find? PowerShell :-), page 3, PowerShell :-), pages 4, 6, and 7, more PowerShell :-). I've finished chapter one which is thirty-five pages long and it's PowerShell :-), PowerShell :-), and more PowerShell :-) and we're not talking about teaching you how to use PowerShell, we're talking about diving into PowerShell with both feet first. Those IT Pro's who have gotten by fine in prior operating system versions without having to learn PowerShell are going to be in for a rude awakening and have the deer in the headlights look when they start studying for this test to upgrade their certifications to Windows Server 2012. I'm glad now that I've been a slacker when it comes to certification tests this year and that I've spent most of my study time learning PowerShell!

Based on what I've seen so far in the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145369666.do" target="_blank">Exam Ref 70-417 book</a>, reading Don Jones and Jeff Hicks new "<a href="http://www.manning.com/jones3/" target="_blank">Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches, Second Edition</a>" book should be a prerequisite:

<a href="http://www.manning.com/jones3/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-5698" title="powershell3" alt="" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/powershell3.jpg?w=119" height="150" width="119" /></a>

I don't work for those guys and I'm not receiving any type of compensation for saying that. I read the previous version of that book when I started learning PowerShell and it's hands down the best book for a beginner who wants to learn PowerShell.

What's on the horizon for me? The <a href="http://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit North America 2013</a>:
