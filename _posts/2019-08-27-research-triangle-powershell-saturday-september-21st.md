The <a href="https://rtpsug.com/pssaturday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research Triangle PowerShell Saturday</a> is Saturday, September 21st, 2019 in Raleigh, North Carolina. There's also a 6-hour security session on Sunday, September 22nd, 2019. Tickets can be purchased for just one of the days or both, but seating is limited for the Sunday post-con so don't wait until the last minute!

Based on <a href="https://rtpsug.com/pssaturday/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the schedule</a>, this event should be almost like a mini PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit which makes it well worth the price of admission. There are three different all-day tracks on Saturday covering PowerShell 101, PowerShell Tools, and DevOps &amp; Security.

I took vacation and paid out of pocket the past two years to speak at and attend PowerShell Saturday / PowerShell on the River in Chattanooga.

How often do you have a chance to attend an event like this on the east coast? The return on investment for your career is priceless when it comes to learning from subject matter experts and networking with others.
