<a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-14969 size-full" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/powershell101-150x194.png" alt="" width="150" height="194" /></a>This morning, I published Chapter 4 of my new book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a>. The book now contains chapters one through four and is forty percent complete. The book will contain a minimum of ten chapters when it's completed later this year.

Interested, but not ready to commit to purchasing it? Chapter 1 is available as a free download and I've created a <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2017/02/02/video-powershell-101-the-no-nonsense-beginners-guide-to-powershell/" target="_blank">video</a> that demonstrates many of the concepts covered in Chapter 1.

If you’re interested in purchasing the book, consider buying it while it’s still a work in progress. The price of the book increases slightly with each chapter that’s released.
