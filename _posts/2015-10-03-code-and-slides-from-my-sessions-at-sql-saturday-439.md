Today I presented two wildly successful sessions at SQL Saturday #439 in Columbus, GA. The code and slides from my "<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/439/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=37499" target="_blank">How do I Get-Started with PowerShell?</a>" session can be downloaded <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/SQLSat439_How-do-I-Get-Started-with-PowerShell.zip">here</a> and the code and slides from my "<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/439/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=37500" target="_blank">PS C:\&gt; Get-Started -With PowerShell Desired State Configuration</a>" session can be downloaded <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/SQLSat439_Get-Started-with-PowerShell-Desired-State-Configuration.zip">here</a>.

The custom functions that are referenced in the code from the DSC session can be downloaded as part of <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/DSC" target="_blank">my MrDSC module</a> from GitHub.
