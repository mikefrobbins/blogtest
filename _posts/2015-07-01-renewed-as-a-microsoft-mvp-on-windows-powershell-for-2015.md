I received the official notification earlier today confirming that I've been renewed as a <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Mike%20F.%20Robbins-5000891" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP on Windows PowerShell</a> for 2015:

I would like to thank everyone who has helped me along the way! Here's to another year of writing more awesome blogs on this site as well as guest blogs for other sites, speaking at conferences and for user groups, and running the <a href="http://mspsug.com/" target="_blank">Mississippi PowerShell User Group</a>.
