This years <a href="http://powershell.org/games/" target="_blank">Scripting Games</a> are scheduled to be kicked off during the <a href="http://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit North America 2013</a> which begins on April 22nd. That's about two and a half weeks away at this point.

In previous years, there have been two categories and it's my understanding that this year, there will be three categories. One for PowerShell beginners, one for advanced PowerShell scripters as in previous years, and a new category for people who aren't actually competing in the events but want to grade or rate other peoples scripts. What? You heard me correctly. This year, scripts will be graded or rated by the public as well as other scripting games contestants.

How do I know if I should compete in the beginner class or the advanced class? If you're new to PowerShell, then the answer is simple, compete in the beginner class, but what if I feel I'm somewhere in-between?

The Beginner Class
<span style="line-height:1.5;">If you primarily use PowerShell to accomplish tasks via one liners and aren't creating tools for other junior level IT personnel to use, then I would suggest competing in the beginner class and the "</span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.manning.com/jones3/" target="_blank">Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches, Second Edition</a><span style="line-height:1.5;">" book would be an excellent study guide to prepare for the scripting games. Receive 50% off with promo code </span><strong style="line-height:1.5;">dotd0404cc</strong> on your purchase of this book today only<span style="line-height:1.5;">.</span>

The Advanced Class
<span style="line-height:1.5;">If you're a toolmaker who writes scripts and/or advanced functions that are routinely turned over to other IT staff members to use, then I would suggest competing in the advanced class and the "</span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.manning.com/jones4/" target="_blank">Learn PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches</a><span style="line-height:1.5;">" book is an excellent study guide for the advanced category events. You can also receive half off of this book today only with promo code <strong>dotd0404cc</strong>.</span>

Although I don't consider myself a toolmaker today, I'll be competing in the advanced category so I can learn and become a toolmaker. That's what the scripting games are all about, learning and challenging yourself to become better.
