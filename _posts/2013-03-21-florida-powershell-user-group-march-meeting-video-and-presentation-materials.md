The <a href="http://www.maxtblog.com/flpsug-speakers-lineup-for-2013/" target="_blank">Florida PowerShell User Group</a> March Meeting was this past Tuesday, March 19th. I was the speaker for this meeting and from what I've heard, my presentation was a huge success! The presentation and the <em>Get-History</em> output from the commands that were demonstrated during the presentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flpsug-meeting-031913.zip">here</a>. Use posh031913 for the zip file password.

We recorded the entire "PowerShell Fundamentals for Beginners" presentation:
