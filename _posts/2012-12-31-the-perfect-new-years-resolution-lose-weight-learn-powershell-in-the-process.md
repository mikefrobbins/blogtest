The most common New Year's resolution has to do with either losing weight or getting yourself into better shape. I thought I would share the secret of how I lost 50+ pounds, kept it off, and learned PowerShell in the process. Sound like something worth doing?

Let's face it, there's no easy way to lose weight, although you don't have to starve yourself to lose those pounds either. Losing weight takes time, you didn't put it on overnight and you're not going to take it off overnight. I often hear people say "I don't have time to exercise or eat right". You should make time to exercise and eat properly as if your life depends on it, because it probably does.

Diets don't work and starving yourself only slows down your metabolism which may make you lose weight in the short term, but once you start eating normally again, you'll put all the weight back on and possibly even more. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you're going to have to change your lifestyle. Remember: You are what you eat. If you eat mega sized meals, your going to be a mega sized person, it's just that simple. Eating leaner and healthier foods does cost a little more, but offset that cost by eating just a little bit less than normal. Don't skip breakfast, eat your heaviest meal mid-day, and your lightest meal in the evenings. A couple of healthy (low fat) snacks a day are fine, just not at night.

I prefer to get outside for my exercise, but this time of the year that's almost impossible with it being dark when I leave for work and dark when I get home, not to mention how cold it is outside this time of the year and all of the family commitments I have. That's why I also own a treadmill. I roll out of bed a half hour or so early each morning to walk a couple of miles on the treadmill (uphill). I figure that's an efficient use of my time since it's less than the travel time that most people would spend driving to and from the local gym, although I'm all for someone going to the gym if that's what it takes to motivate them.

I do have to admit that walking on the treadmill is boring and thirty minutes can seem like a lifetime, that's where learning PowerShell comes into the picture. Watching PowerShell training videos while walking on the treadmill will make the time go by a lot faster and it's an even more efficient use of your time since you'll not only be exercising your body, but your brain as well.

The most recent training videos that I've watched while walking on the treadmill are the PowerShell training videos by <a href="http://www.interfacett.com/" target="_blank">Interface Technical Training</a>. Their entire <a href="http://videotraining.interfacett.com/" target="_blank">video library</a> is available as an online subscription based service. There are several things that I really like about their training videos. They offer lots of their <a href="http://videotraining.interfacett.com/" target="_blank">training videos</a> for free to try out their service before you have to commit and subscribe. Once you've completed the free training videos, a subscription to their entire video library cost only $25 a month which is on a month to month payment basis. They offer training videos on subjects other than PowerShell as well which are also included with your subscription. The quality of the videos is top notch. The ones that I've watched were all authored by Don Jones who is a well known PowerShell MVP and expert in the industry who people pay thousands of dollars to attend conferences to see.

I place my tablet device on the treadmill where you would normally put a book and two miles along with several training videos are behind me before I know it. One of the other things that I like about the <a href="http://videotraining.interfacett.com/" target="_blank">training video's</a> at <a href="http://www.interfacett.com/" target="_blank">Interface Technical Training</a> is the volume (the presenters voice sound level) of all of the ones I've watched is excellent so there's no need for headphones unless that's what you prefer.

Hopefully you've found this blog informative and maybe even motivational. The next time we see one another, you'll be healthier, thinner, know more about PowerShell, you'll feel better, and best of all you'll have more self-esteem and a sense of accomplishment.
