If you're interested in some free PowerShell training, I'll be presenting two PowerShell sessions at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/593/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #593</a> in Birmingham, Alabama this Saturday, March 18th.

<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/593/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15117 size-full" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sqlsat593.jpg" alt="" width="983" height="479" /></a>

My first one hour presentation begins at 9:40am central time and is geared for beginners. The content covered in this session is based off of <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank">a book by the same title</a> that I'm currently writing.

<strong>PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</strong>
<em>Interested in PowerShell but not sure how to get started? Already have some experience but still having trouble with the basic concepts? This session is for you! Learn to easily figure out what the commands are and how to use those commands without searching the Internet. Extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server. During this presentation, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate several of the core PowerShell cmdlets along with writing one-liners and basics scripts. We’ll discuss how to prevent resume generating events when making changes with PowerShell. Learn what objects, properties, and methods are along with how they’re used in PowerShell. Not a developer? PowerShell is one of those technologies that you can be extremely effective with whether you’re a developer or an IT Pro.</em>

My second one hour presentation begins at 1pm (immediately after the lunch break) and is an intermediate level session.

<strong>PowerShell Non-Monolithic Script Module Design</strong>
<em>Creating a script module in PowerShell is a very simplistic process, but there are a number of reasons why you might not want to create one huge monolithic PSM1 script module file that contains all of your module’s functions. During this session, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how to separate each of your module’s functions into its own dedicated PS1 file that’s dot-sourced from your script module’s PSM1 file along with discussing this design methodology and the challenges that it creates. Many times resolving one problem seems to create more problems such as cmdlets from other modules showing up as being exported by your module. The solution to these problems and more will be provided during this session. Mike will also demonstrate using a Pester test to validate that all of the functions are indeed exported along with using a function to help automate the module manifest update process when additional functions are added to your module.</em>

Both of my sessions are located in room 325 of Thomas Russell Hall of Samford University. The address is 800 Lakeshore Drive, Birmingham, AL 35229 (USA). Be sure to check <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/593/Sessions/Schedule.aspx" target="_blank">the event schedule</a> for any last minute changes.

If you're interested in eating lunch onsite, they do charge a $10 lunch fee, but the lunch fee is optional. You can always bring your own lunch or go offsite for lunch although, you'll be missing out on opportunities to network with others in the industry if you choose to do so.

I hope to see you in one if not both of my sessions!
