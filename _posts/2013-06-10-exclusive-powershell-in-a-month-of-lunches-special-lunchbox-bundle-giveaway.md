The June meeting of the Mississippi PowerShell User Group is tomorrow night, June 11th at 8:30pm Central Time. This is a virtual (online) meeting so anyone from anywhere can join in!

Our guest speaker for this month is well known author, speaker, and PowerShell MVP Jeffery Hicks. While at the PowerShell Summit back in April, Jeffery donated a limited edition PowerShell in a Month of Lunches bundle to include a special limited edition lunchbox, <a href="http://manning.com/jones3/" target="_blank">Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches Second Edition</a> book, and <a href="http://manning.com/jones4/" target="_blank">Learn PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches</a> book as shown in the following image:

Since I had access to both Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks, I asked both of them to sign the books generically as shown in the following images:

These are hand written signatures and not stamps:
