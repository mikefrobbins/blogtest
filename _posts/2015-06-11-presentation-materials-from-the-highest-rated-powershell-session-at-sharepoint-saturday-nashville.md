This past Saturday, I presented a session titled "<a href="http://www.spsevents.org/city/Nashville/Nashville2015/_layouts/15/SPSEvents/Speakers/Session.aspx?SpeakerId=913&amp;ID=33&amp;source=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spsevents.org%2fcity%2fNashville%2fNashville2015%2f_layouts%2f15%2fSPSEvents%2fSpeakers%2fSpeaker.aspx%3fID%3d913%26IsDlg%3d1" target="_blank">PS C:\&gt; Get-Started -With 'PowerShell for SharePoint'</a>" at <a href="http://www.spsevents.org/city/nashville/nashville2015" target="_blank">SharePoint Saturday Nashville</a> and I'm happy to say that it was the highest rated PowerShell session of the event! How do I know this? Because it was the only PowerShell session of the event :-).

The code and slides that I used during my presentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/SPSNashville2015.zip">here</a>. There are multiple scripts included in the zip file and only portions of each one was used during the actual demo.

Here's a list of the items from the "Resources" slide that was shown towards the end of my presentation that I recommended if you're interested in learning more about PowerShell:
