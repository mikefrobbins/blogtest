You may think I woke up early today which is Thanksgiving morning to write this blog post, but WordPress has a scheduling feature that allows you to write your blog posts days, weeks, or even months ahead of time and schedule when you’d like to have them published. This allows you to add a level of professionalism to your blog by publishing articles on a more consistent basis instead of posting ten in a day and then not posting anymore for months. You can still write those ten blog posts in one day, but schedule one of them to be published per week for the next ten weeks. I try to publish one blog entry every Thursday and today or at least the day this post will be published is Thanksgiving. <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/schedule-blog.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1410" title="schedule-blog" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/schedule-blog.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="137" /></a>This entry will be posted at 5:30am while I’m hopefully fast asleep much like the people who write newspaper articles. This can also help you build up a following of readers who will know to check your blog site regularly because you are publishing new articles on a consistent basis. I can't take all the credit for the idea of scheduling your blog posts though. I want to thank <a href="http://modernresume.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Steve Jones</a> for his "The Modern Resume: Building Your Brand" session at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/" target="_blank">SQL Saturday</a> in Pensacola Florida this past June which is where the idea came from. Prior to that, I was just shooting from the hip with my blog posts.
