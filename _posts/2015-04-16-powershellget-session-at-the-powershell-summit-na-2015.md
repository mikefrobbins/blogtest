The <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america-2015/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit North America 2015</a> is next week! I'll be presenting a session on <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn835097(v=wps.640).aspx" target="_blank">PowerShellGet</a> at 2:30pm on Tuesday, April 21st in the room named Kilimanjaro.

The official title for my session is:
<em>PowerShellGet: The BIG EASY way to discover, install, and update PowerShell modules
</em><a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/powershellget-slide1a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11521" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/powershellget-slide1a.jpg" alt="powershellget-slide1a" width="640" height="480" />
</a>The abstract (or synopsis) for my session will give you a little information about what I plan to cover during the presentation:<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/powershellget-slide1a.jpg">
</a>

<em>What process do you currently have in place for sharing PowerShell modules within your organization? It’s probably haphazard to say the least, but you’ll be happy to know that thanks to the new features provided by the cmdlets in the PowerShellGet module that’s part of PowerShell version 5, you’ll be able to send your current haphazard process to Out-Null and never have to deal with it again! During this session, PowerShell MVP and Scripting Games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate finding modules, publishing modules, installing modules, and updating modules. We’ll start out with the default online Microsoft repository and then move onto installing two of our own private repositories, one using Visual Studio and another using ProGet. We’ll also cover the caveats of publishing your own modules including what metadata is required be able to successfully publish modules to a PowerShellGet repository.</em><a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/powershellget-slide1a.jpg">

I'll warn you that my session only has a few PowerPoint slides and is very demonstration heavy so if you're attending my session to learn about PowerPoint, you'll be disappointed.

I hope to see you in my session at the PowerShell Summit North America 2015, but even if you're not attending my session, I hope you'll introduce yourself to me if we happen to cross paths. If you have a PowerShell story you would like to share, I would love to hear it!
