I’ll be presenting "PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell" at <a href="https://www.powershellchatt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerShell on the River</a> in Chattanooga Tennessee this Saturday, August 10th. The event itself is a mini-conference with all day sessions on Friday, August 9th and then numerous speakers presenting in three different tracks on Saturday, August 10th.

Here’s a little information about what you can expect from my session:

<strong>PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</strong>
<em>Interested in PowerShell but not sure how to get started? Already have some experience but still having trouble with the basic concepts? This session is for you! Learn to easily figure out what the commands are and how to use those commands without searching the Internet. Extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server. During this presentation, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate several of the core PowerShell cmdlets along with writing one-liners and basics scripts. We’ll discuss how to prevent resume generating events when making changes with PowerShell. Learn what objects, properties, and methods are along with how they’re used in PowerShell. Not a developer? PowerShell is one of those technologies that you can be extremely effective with whether you’re a developer or an IT Pro.</em>

My presentation begins at 9am at Chattanooga State Community College, 4501 Amnicola Hwy, Chattanooga, TN 37406. Be sure to check <a href="https://www.powershellchatt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the event schedule</a> for any changes to the schedule or location. The PowerShell code used during my demonstrations and the slide deck from my session will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.

Registration is required and this event does cost a small fee, but it's extremely reasonable especially when you consider lunch is included. It's such a great deal that I'm paying out of pocket and burning a day and a half of vacation myself to both attend and present. I attended last year so I can definitely speak from experience, when I say that it's well worth the cost. Your employer might even pay for you to attend, but if not, keep in mind that it's not your employers responsibility to keep you marketable and relevant in the industry. If you're not willing to invest in yourself, why should they?

Here's a picture of the swag I received last year.
