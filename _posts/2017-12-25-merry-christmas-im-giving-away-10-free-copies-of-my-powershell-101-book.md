Earlier this year, I announced that I would be writing a new book "<a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a>" that would be completed before the end of the year and published on <a href="https://leanpub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leanpub.com</a>. As I wrote the chapters, I incremented the percentage complete on the book's webpage. A few days ago, I made a few final corrections and marked the book as being 100% complete.

One thing that I'm a big believer in is do what you say you're going to do. I wanted to make sure the book was complete before years end since that's what I had committed myself to. If you're not going to do something, then don't say you're going to do it. It's that simple.

In celebration of completing the book and since it's Christmas day, I'm gifting 10 copies of this new book on a first come, first served basis. Simply use <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101/c/ELJgdEaP7qZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this URL</a> to redeem a special coupon. There's no reason to feel crummy if you miss out on one of these free copies of the book.

I'm also putting the book on sale for $0.99 (reduced from the suggested price of $15.99) from now until the end of the year. Use <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101/c/ZHf6zIL1Y668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this URL</a> to access the 99-cent sale. As always, with Leanpub.com, you can pay more. All of the proceeds from this book help keep this blog site online and support my community activities as well as helping to fund any cost associated with running the <a href="http://mspsug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi PowerShell User Group</a>.
