This blog article today represents a milestone on this blog site as it's blog article number 365. That means you could read one blog article on this site per day and it would take you an entire year to read all of the articles that are published on this site.

I started blogging on this site back in 2009 which was approximately 6 years ago. You'll notice that I have twelve blog articles from September of 2009, but I actually started blogging earlier that year and copy/pasted many of those first twelve blog articles from another blog site of mine that I had started earlier that year.

Early on, my focus wasn't necessarily all PowerShell but my first blog article that included PowerShell commands was published on this site on September 9th of 2009. Since then, I've become much more focused on PowerShell and nowadays you'll rarely read a blog article on this site that isn't about PowerShell.

I've also deleted a number of blog articles over the years that were simply off topic and since I'm a big believer in personal branding, I wanted to make sure that my blog site was promoting my brand. Trust me, there's a method to my madness when I tell someone in passing that they can reach my blog site by using the alias <a href="http://mrpowershell.com" target="_blank">MrPowerShell.com</a> (Mr for my first and last initials).

Even with the removal of those off-topic blog articles that I previously mentioned, I've blogged consistently every single month on this site since those first blog articles back in 2009 and I never want to be too busy that I'm unable to write blog articles on my own site. As always, with the exception of some shameless self-promotion, this site is completely advertisement free. That's right, I don't get paid for any of this but I can't tell you how many times I've forgotten the specifics of how to do something and an article on this site has saved me countless hours of having to figure it out again.

Drop me a line sometime if you enjoy my blog articles or have comments and/or suggestions. Good or bad, I'd like to hear it. You can post a comment to this blog article which will be made public or solve the security related riddle on <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/about/" target="_blank">my about page</a> to obtain my email address if you would like your comment to remain private.
