I've attended <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft TechEd North America</a> every year consecutively for the past four years and this year will make five years in a row that I've attended.

If there's a specific technology you're interested in, there are precons on the Sunday prior <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9200" alt="teched-2014-im-going" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/teched-2014-im-going.jpg" width="251" height="250" /></a>to TechEd for an additional fee that are a really good value. I've attended Exchange, SharePoint, and SQL Server precons at TechEd in the past.  <a href="http://www.toddklindt.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Todd Klindt</a> who is a SharePoint MVP is doing a SharePoint precon again this year. I attended a previous version of his precon so I can definitely recommend that one (he's a PowerShell guy too). Unfortunately, I'm not attending a precon this year, but I keep hoping they'll have a PowerShell precon some day (I guess the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit North America 2014</a> is my precon).

I thought I would share my schedule, or at least the sessions I'm planning to attend (so far) this year. They're the typical sessions you'd expect to find me in (the PowerShell sessions).

The only non-PowerShell session I've added to my schedule so far is Ed Horley's IPv6 session on Thursday.

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-11_12-17-31.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9625" alt="2014-04-11_12-17-31" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-11_12-17-31.png" width="411" height="256" /></a>

There are also some PowerShell related hands on labs:

I'm not sure if you have to be signed up for the instructor led labs if you want to attend them, but I would go ahead and add them to your schedule if you plan to attend them since there are waiting lists and you'll receive this message if the lab and wait list is full:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-11_12-08-26.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9627" alt="2014-04-11_12-08-26" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-11_12-08-26.png" width="522" height="170" /></a>

Ending up on the wait list for an instructor led lab isn't that bad because you'll receive an email if they add additional labs that repeat the one you're on the wait list for:
