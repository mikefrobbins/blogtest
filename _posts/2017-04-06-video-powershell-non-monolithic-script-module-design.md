This past Tuesday night, I presented a session on "PowerShell Non-Monolithic Script Module Design" for the Arizona PowerShell Users Group. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ajz3WT0A#t=10m30s" target="_blank">video</a> from that presentation is now available.

The presentation begins at 10 minutes and 30 seconds seconds into the video.
