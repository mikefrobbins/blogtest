I presented a beginner level session for the <a href="https://powershell.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PowerShell Virtual Chapter of PASS</a> yesterday titled "PS C:\&gt; Get-Started -With 'PowerShell for SQL Server'". The session is entry level PowerShell and designed for those people who haven't yet embraced PowerShell because I often hear "How do I get started with PowerShell"? My new answer: Watch this video.

The first two thirds or so of the presentation is more or less generic because the basics for someone who is just getting started with PowerShell are the same regardless of what product you're using it with.

The other session that I presented for them a couple of years ago on "PowerShell Fundamentals for Beginners" which is referenced during this presentation can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFX97evt_7Akx_R9ovfiSwQ" target="_blank">their YouTube channel</a> along with some other great PowerShell content.

The code and slides used during this presentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/Get-Started_with_PowerShell_for_SQLServer.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
