I can definitely speak from experience when I say that this is the best PowerShell conference in North America if you're interested in PowerShell and networking with other like-minded people. I've attended every year since its inception and have spoken at it about half as many times.

While I'm in no way affiliated with the organizers, based on their site, they're not only looking for deep-dive content but also intermediate sessions. Think you're not advanced enough to speak at a conference like this one? Then you need to read "<a href="https://leanpub.com/bethemaster3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Be the Master</a>" by <a href="https://twitter.com/concentrateddon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Jones</a>. Everyone has something to share and everyone is a master of something and a novice at other things.

Maybe you think you're not a good enough speaker to present at conferences? Practice makes perfect. Try starting out by speaking remotely for a small user group or by presenting a session in front of a group of co-workers. Build yourself up to speaking at PowerShell or SQL Saturday events and then you'll be ready to speak in front of hundreds of people at conferences. I know because I've done it and while I'm not a professional speaker, I don't mind sharing what I've learned while working day to day in the trenches.

Anxiety? Everyone has it. Those who don't aren't normal. I've spoken at more conferences than I can count and I still get nervous each and every time. Some people fear public speaking more than death itself. Prepare, but don't think about it too much or you'll be a nervous wreck. I try to have a few slides along with a remote so I'm not tied to the podium when I start speaking. Being able to walk around a little helps me warm up. Have all of your code typed up ahead of time. Don't try to think, type, and talk all at the same time.

Worried about questions? Don't. Do your best to answer them, but "I don't know" is a great answer if you honestly don't know. Find the answer and followup with the person afterwards. Consider writing a blog article about the question if you think others would benefit from it. If one person has the question, more probably do as well.
