Registration for the <a href="http://powershellsummit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell &amp; DevOps Global Summit 2018</a> opens on Wednesday, November 1st which is less than one week away. I've attended every one of these conferences that have been held in North America since its inception 5 years ago. I speak from experience when I say now is the time to ask for approval to attend this conference because it has sold out each year and it's not a matter of if it will sell out, but when will it sell out?

The <a href="https://cdn-powershell.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event brochure</a> has lots of great information about why you should attend the conference along with some details to be aware of so be sure to take a look at it. In short, attending this event will help your company do more with less and it will also help your career by building your skills while networking with others in the industry. Best of all, you'll get to learn from people like <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffrey Snover</a> and the PowerShell team.

Once you have approval to attend:

<hr />

Book your hotel room using the discount codes found in <a href="https://powershell.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the event brochure</a> because there aren't enough discounted rooms for the number of people who will be attending. Why not? Because the conference is liable for the cost of the rooms if they don't sell. I have personally stayed at all of the hotels on the list and they're all really good if not great. I stayed at Hotel 116 four years ago which appears to have been remodeled since then, the Courtyard Marriott for the past two years, and the Marriott two years ago while attending the MVP Summit.

Once registration opens, buy your conference ticket as soon as possible. Be aware that the tickets are non-refundable, but substitutions can be made within a certain number of days before the event. See <a href="https://powershell.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the event brochure</a> for more details.

Don't wait until the last minute to buy your plane ticket. The last couple of times that I've traveled to the Bellevue area, I purchased my plane tickets more than two months out while tracking the prices with <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Flights</a> to see if I purchased them too soon. The prices only increased after I purchased them.

You don't need a car. It will be a lot more hassle and expensive than it's worth. I rented a car the first year of the summit because there wasn't much in the area where it was held on the Microsoft campus. All of the hotels listed in the brochure are within walking distance of the Meydenbauer Center which is where it's held at now. I've used <a href="https://shuttleexpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shuttle Express</a> the last half-dozen times or so that I've been to the Sea-Tac airport while traveling to the Bellevue area. I've always use the shared van option which is the cheapest, although you may have to wait a few minutes and ride with others. Make sure you use the Airport/Hotel radio buttons when selecting pickup and destination on the Shuttle Express website. If you select the address radio button and specify the Address of the hotel instead, it will cost more.
