This past Saturday, I presented a session titled "<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/392/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=20709" target="_blank">PS C:\&gt; Get-Started -With 'PowerShell Desired State Configuration'</a>" at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/392/EventHome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #392 in Atlanta</a>. The code and slides that I used during the presentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/SQLSaturday392-Atlanta2015.zip">here</a>.

Some of the functions used in the downloadable code are part of my DSC toolkit module that can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/DSC" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Keep in mind that module is a work in progress.

Here's a list of the items from the "Resources" slide that was shown towards the end of my presentation that I recommended in case you're interested in learning more about DSC:
