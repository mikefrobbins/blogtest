On Christmas day, <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2017/12/25/merry-christmas-im-giving-away-10-free-copies-of-my-powershell-101-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I announced</a> that my new book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101/c/ZHf6zIL1Y668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a> had been completed. I gave away 10 copies of it along with placing it on sale for 99-cents (reduced from the suggested price of $15.99) until the end of the year.

Time is running out, but there's still time to grab a copy at this price.

<a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101/c/ZHf6zIL1Y668" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16030" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cover_270x350.png" alt="" width="270" height="350" /></a>

Use <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101/c/ZHf6zIL1Y668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this URL</a> to access the 99-cent sale. As always, with Leanpub.com, you can pay more. All of the proceeds from this book help keep this blog site online and support my community activities as well as helping to fund any cost associated with running the <a href="http://mspsug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi PowerShell User Group</a>.
