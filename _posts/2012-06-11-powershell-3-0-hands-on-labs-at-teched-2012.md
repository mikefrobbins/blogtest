Thinking about learning the new features of PowerShell 3.0 at Microsoft TechEd North America 2012? If you're planning to get some hands on experience using the hands on labs, don't waste your time. I attempted to go through the WSV11-HOL "What's New in Windows PowerShell 3.0 " this morning:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/teched-pslabs1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4482" title="teched-pslabs1" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/teched-pslabs1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="218" /></a>

Only to find out the resolution (screen size) on the virtual machine is set too high to view the content:

I also attempted the WSV12-HOL "Introduction to Windows PowerShell Fundamentals 3.0 ", but had the same problem:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/teched-pslabs3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4486" title="teched-pslabs3" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/teched-pslabs3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>

Even though this is my third year in a row at TechEd, this is my first experience with the hands  on labs and it's a failure. According to the onsite Microsoft representatives, this problem was reported yesterday and there's no ETA on a resolution. How is it that we can have a conference that's sold out to people who do this for a living but we can't get someone to adjust the resolution on a VM?

I spoke to another PowerShell enthusiast yesterday (<a href="http://twitter.com/cruz_daniel" target="_blank">@cruz_daniel</a>) who said this problem still exists but he discovered a work-around and was able to complete the PowerShell 3.0 hands on labs. The work around is to click on the instructions that are partially covered up by the VM and use Cntl  + mouse wheel to zoom out so you can view them.
