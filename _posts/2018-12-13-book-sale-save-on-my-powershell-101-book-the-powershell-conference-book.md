<em>Before PowerShell, I spent the first third of my career as an IT Pro pointing and clicking in the GUI and I decided to write this book to save IT Pros from themselves who are reluctant to learn PowerShell.</em>

<em>Instead of a book that just covers topics with fictitious scenarios, this book is more of a condensed version targeting the specific topics that I’ve found an IT Pro needs to know initially to be successful with PowerShell in a real world production environment. It’s a collection of what I wish someone would have told me when I started learning PowerShell along with the tips, tricks, and best practices that I've learned while using PowerShell during the past 10 years.</em>

<em>This book focuses on PowerShell version 5.1 in a Microsoft Active Directory domain environment running on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. All currently supported versions of Windows and previous versions of PowerShell beginning with PowerShell version 1.0 are briefly mentioned in this book.</em>

<em>This book is designed to be like a conference in a book where each chapter is written by a different author who is a subject matter expert on the topic covered in their chapter. Each chapter is also independent of the others so you can read one chapter, ten chapters, or all of them. You can start with the first chapter, the last one, or somewhere in-between and not miss out on anything related to that particular topic. This book is written for the intermediate to advanced audience. Prior experience with PowerShell is highly recommended.</em>
