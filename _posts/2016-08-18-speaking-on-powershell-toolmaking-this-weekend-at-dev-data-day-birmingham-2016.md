I'll be presenting a session on PowerShell Toolmaking with Advanced Functions and Script Modules this Saturday, August 20th at <a href="http://devdataday.com" target="_blank">{dev = data} DAY Birmingham 2016</a>. Here's what you can expect from my session:

<em>"Transitioning from writing PowerShell one-liners and basic scripts to creating reusable PowerShell tools with advanced functions and script modules can be a daunting task and with all the different ways that you’ll find on the Internet to accomplish the same task, it can definitely seem overwhelming. During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will demystify many of the intricacies of toolmaking while demonstrating the best practices for using parameters, parameter validation, cmdlet binding, supports should process, pipeline input, error handling, module manifests, and custom formatting. This session will NOT be a deep dive into any one of the previously listed topics. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended."</em>

My session begins at 10:15am in room 225 at Thomas D. Russell Hall on the campus of Samford University in Birmingham, AL. As always, be sure to check the event schedule for any schedule changes.

Both the code and slide deck from my presentation will be available in <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.
