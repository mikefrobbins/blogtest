Here's what the inside of the three backpack choices look like at Microsoft TechEd North America 2012. I thought I was going to choose the silver bag since the pictures seemed to have a silver Buck Rogers look, but I ended up going with the blue urban camo bag since the silver one has a hideous glow in the dark neon green color on the inside of it:

Here's what the <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEd_NA/status/211592323010793472/photo/1" target="_blank">outside</a> of the backpacks look like. There's been lots of pictures of the outside of the bags previously posted on the web.

The backpacks are definitely smaller this year, although I consider that a good thing with the exception of not being able to carry a 12 pack of free soda back to the hotel at night.
