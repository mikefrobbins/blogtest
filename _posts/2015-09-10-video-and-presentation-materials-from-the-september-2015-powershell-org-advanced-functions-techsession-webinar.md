Last week I presented a session titled "<a href="http://powershell.org/wp/2015/08/26/techsession-webinar-the-top-10-considerations-when-writing-powershell-advanced-functions/" target="_blank">The Top 10 Considerations When Writing PowerShell Advanced Functions</a>" for the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/event/techsession-the-top-10-considerations-when-writing-powershell-advanced-functions/" target="_blank">September 2015 PowerShell.org TechSession Webinar</a>.

The video from that presentation is now available:

The presentation materials including the code and slides can be downloaded from <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/The-Top-10-Considerations-When-Writing-PowerShell-Advanced-Functions.zip">here</a>.

I received a question during the presentation about how to determine what the type accelerators are and the answer to that question can be found in this <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2013/07/08/use-powershell-to-find-powershell-type-accelerators.aspx" target="_blank">Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog article</a> (thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/getch3028" target="_blank">Nicholas Getchell</a> for the link to that article).

The <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2015/04/17/free-ebook-on-powershell-advanced-functions/" target="_blank">free eBook on PowerShell Advanced Functions</a> that I referenced during the presentation can be downloaded <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/downloads/PSBlogWeek-AdvancedFunctions.zip">here</a>.
