Since this is my first year entering the <a href="http://2012sg.poshcode.org/" target="_blank">PowerShell Scripting Games</a>, I’m only submitting scripts for the beginner events but I’m also taking a look at the advanced ones to get an idea of what kind of knowledge is needed for them. It’s not too late to join in on the fun. Make sure you read the requirements of each event carefully, create your script, test it, and think about it for a while before submitting it.

I had four stars on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/02/the-2012-scripting-games-beginner-event-1-use-windows-powershell-to-identify-a-working-set-of-processes.aspx" target="_blank">first Beginner Event</a>:
<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012sg-be1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3636" title="2012sg-be1" alt="" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012sg-be1.png" width="640" height="57" /></a>

Another judge must have given me 3 stars since I now have 3.5 out of 5 on the first event:
<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012sg-be1-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3637" title="2012sg-be1-2" alt="" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2012sg-be1-2.png" width="640" height="59" /></a>

The reason I say to think about it before submitting your script is because I almost submitted a script that did something incorrectly (I don't want to spoil the fun). Make sure you click on the screenshot of the sample output provided as part of the requirements of the scenario and view the larger image of it to get an idea of what the output should look like (that’s what clued me into knowing that my script was wrong). After re-reading the requirements I found the portion that I initially missed.

So far I’ve got 5 stars on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/03/2012-scripting-games-beginner-event-2-find-stoppable-running-services.aspx" target="_blank">second Beginner Event</a> with some good comments from Ed Wilson (aka "The Scripting Guy" himself). I’m just some guy in trenches but getting five stars from The Scripting Guy makes me feel like a rock star!

I’m glad I decided to read “<a href="http://www.manning.com/jones/" target="_blank">Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches</a>” by Don Jones earlier this year including working all the exercises since I feel that it prepared me for these beginner events. There's tons of information and tips out there. Search for the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%232012SG" target="_blank">#2012sg hash tag</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I enjoyed the Scripting Games prep videos by the <a href="http://powershelldownunder.com/" target="_blank">PowerShell Down Under</a> guys.
