I’m honored and humbled to be <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)</a> for a fifth consecutive year. I received notification this past weekend confirming that I’ve been renewed for another year. The first two Microsoft MVP awards that I received were for PowerShell and due to changes to Microsoft’s MVP award program, the latest three have been for Cloud and Datacenter Management, although my focus is still PowerShell.
