I've been working in Information Technology for 20 years this year and I've wasted more than half of my career in the GUI (Graphical User Interface) having to learn GUI's for numerous products and different versions of all those different products over the years, more products and versions than I can count.

Back in th<a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Mike%20F.%20Robbins-5000891" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10171" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wiiu-mvp.jpg" alt="wiiu-mvp" width="150" height="307" /></a>e VBScript days, I was the dangerous script copy and paster. Then when Exchange Server 2007 shipped, I was forced to learn at least some PowerShell since there were many things that couldn't be accomplished in the GUI, especially prior to SP1, but I was still somewhat of a dangerous script copy and paster.

I decided to get serious about PowerShell when version 2 released, starting out with one-liners and going back to the GUI when I couldn't accomplish the task at hand with a one-liner.

As I became more confident with PowerShell, I progressed to writing scripts, then functions, and modules. I competed in the 2012 beginner category of the Scripting Games and was one of the top finalist. By the time the Scripting Games came around the following year (in 2013), I was ready for the advanced category which I ended up winning.

I can't put an exact date on when I started using PowerShell, but I've been blogging about it on this site since 2009. I started a <a href="http://mspsug.com/" target="_blank">user group</a> with <a href="http://rohnspowershellblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Rohn Edwards</a> and I started speaking at technology events to teach others that you don't have to be a developer to be effective with PowerShell and that there's no future in wasting half of your career using the GUI.

I also believe in taking advantage of opportunities. Opportunities like writing a chapter in the <a href="http://manning.com/hicks/" target="_blank">PowerShell Deep Dives</a> book, being the Head Coach during the Winter 2014 Scripting Games, and speaking at technology events even when it's not convenient.

If you're <a href="http://twitter.com/mikefrobbins" target="_blank">following me on twitter</a> then I'm sure you're already aware that I was awarded the <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Mike%20F.%20Robbins-5000891" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a> (Most Valuable Professional) Award as of July 1st. I would like to thank everyone who nominated me and also everyone who congratulated me.

After winning the scripting games, someone asked me: "What are you going to do with it?". The same answer I gave for that question now applies to being a PowerShell MVP. Maybe someone who wouldn't normally come listen to me speak at a technology event will come and listen to me because I'm "the Scripting Games winner". And now maybe they will attend, listen, and learn about PowerShell from me because "I'm a PowerShell MVP" when that wouldn't have otherwise.

<span style="color: #333333;">Interested in hearing me speak? I'm presenting two PowerShell sessions at </span><a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/324/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #324</a><span style="color: #333333;"> in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on August 2nd. I've submitted PowerShell sessions to <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/328/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #328</a> in Birmingham, Alabama on August 23rd and I plan to submit PowerShell sessions to <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/342/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #342</a> in Mobile, Alabama on September 27th.</span>

One thing to keep in mind if you have the desire to become an MVP is that you don't blog, speak, volunteer, run a user group, and all of these other things to become an MVP, you do them because you enjoy doing them and sharing your knowledge with others &lt;period&gt;.
