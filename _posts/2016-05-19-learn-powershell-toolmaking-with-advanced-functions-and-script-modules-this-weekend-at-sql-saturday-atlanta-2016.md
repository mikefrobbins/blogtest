I'll be presenting a session on <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=47143" target="_blank">PowerShell Toolmaking with Advanced Functions and Script Modules</a> this weekend at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #521 in Atlanta</a>.

Transitioning from writing PowerShell one-liners and basic scripts to creating reusable PowerShell tools with advanced functions and script modules can be a daunting task and with all the different ways that you’ll find on the Internet to accomplish the same task, it can definitely seem overwhelming. During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will demystify many of the intricacies of toolmaking while demonstrating the best practices for using parameters, parameter validation, cmdlet binding, supports should process, pipeline input, error handling, module manifests, and custom formatting. This session will NOT be a deep dive into any one of the previously listed topics. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended. All code shown during this presentation will be made available on GitHub.

My session begins at 9:30am in room 106 (51) at the Alpharetta location of Georgia State University. Be sure to check <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/Sessions/Schedule.aspx" target="_blank">the event schedule</a> for any schedule changes between now and then.

The slide deck and demo code will be posted in <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank">my presentations repository on GitHub</a> prior to the session in case anyone wants to follow along during the presentation.
