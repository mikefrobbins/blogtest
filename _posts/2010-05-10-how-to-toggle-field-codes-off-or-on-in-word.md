<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/field_codes2.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-766" title="field_codes" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/field_codes2.png" alt="" width="205" height="110" /></a>A few days ago a customer contacted me with a Microsoft Word 2007 problem. Codes such as "{ HYPERLINK "mailto:testuser@test.local" }" and "{ DATE @ "MMMM d, yyyy" }" were showing up in one of their documents. This problem is due to "Field Codes" being somehow toggled on. If the problem is with a single document, toggle the field codes off or on by first selecting the entire document with (cntl+a) and then toggle the field codes off or on with (shift-F9). (Alt-F9) also toggled the field codes off and on from the machine I was using.

If the problem is with all documents, then the "Show field codes instead of their values" option has been selected under "Word Options&gt;Advanced" in the "Show document content" section:
<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/show_field_codes.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-772" title="show_field_codes" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/show_field_codes.png" alt="" width="408" height="253" /></a>

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/show_field_codes.png"></a>If the field codes are not showing up on the screen, but show up in print preview and they are printing on all documents instead of the actual data, then the "Print field codes instead of their values" option has been selected under "Word Options&gt;Advanced" in the "Print" section:
<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/print_field_codes1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767" title="print_field_codes" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/print_field_codes1.png" alt="" width="404" height="323" /></a>
