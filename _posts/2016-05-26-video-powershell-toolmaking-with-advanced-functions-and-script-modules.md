I presented a session on <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=47143" target="_blank">PowerShell Toolmaking with Advanced Functions and Script Modules</a> this past weekend at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/521/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #521</a> in Atlanta. I decided to make an attempt to record my session which was presented live in front of a packed room full of attendees:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sqlsatatl2016.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14083" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sqlsatatl2016.jpg" alt="sqlsatatl2016" width="890" height="355" /></a>

The recording turned out very well considering I used the built-in laptop microphone and I moved around during my presentation. The audio levels have been tweaked because they were often too low depending on how far away I was from the computer at any given point in time during the presentation. The <a href="https://youtu.be/oxalhLN_r8o" target="_blank">video</a> is now available:

The slide deck and demo code can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.

I'll be presenting "<em>PowerShell Desired State Configuration from the Trenches</em>" at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/491/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #491 in Pensacola Florida</a> on June 4th and "<em>Building Unconventional SQL Server Tools in PowerShell</em>" at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/498/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #498 in Chattanooga Tennessee</a> on June 25th.
