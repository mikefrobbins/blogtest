Last month I presented a session on <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/CnMp/writing-award-winning-powershell-functions-and-script-modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing Award Winning PowerShell Functions and Script Modules</a> at the <a href="https://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit</a> in Seattle, Washington. The session seemed to be well received by the audience based on the feedback that I received from the attendees.

The session was also completely full. I'm glad it was recorded so anyone who was unable to attend can watch it.
