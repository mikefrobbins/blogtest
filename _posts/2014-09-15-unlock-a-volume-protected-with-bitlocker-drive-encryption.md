Have a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine that runs the Server Core (no-GUI) installation of the operating system? Maybe that server has a volume that is protected with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker" target="_blank">BitLocker Drive Encryption</a>? If so, how would you unlock the encryption so you can access the data on that volume without using a graphical user interface?

With PowerShell of course, specifically the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj649833.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Unlock-BitLocker</em></a> PowerShell cmdlet:
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">Unlock-BitLocker -MountPoint 'D:' -Password (Read-Host 'Enter Password' -AsSecureString)</pre>
