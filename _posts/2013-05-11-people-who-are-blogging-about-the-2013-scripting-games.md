I'm sure that most people can easily find any of the blogs of the official judges from the 2013 Scripting Games. I recommend reading those blogs whether you're competing in the scripting games or not since there's a wealth of great information contained in them. The best place to find those blogs if you don't know already is the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/category/announcements/scripting-games/judges-notes/" target="_blank">Judges Notes section</a> under the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/category/announcements/scripting-games/" target="_blank">Scripting Games area</a> on <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/" target="_blank">PowerShell.org</a> so there's no reason to duplicate them here.

There are also a number of people who are competing in the Scripting Games that are writing blog articles of their own blog sites. A couple of the ones that I'm aware of are listed below and while they're my competition in the advanced class and have links promoting their Scripting Games entries in their blogs (I do the same thing),  I don't mind promoting their blog articles because there's some great information to be found in them. I'm actually glad they provided links to their entries because both of these guys are excellent PowerShell scripters and you could learn a lot from viewing their Scripting Games entries. Ultimately the scripting games is all about the community learning more about using PowerShell best practices in a friendly competition that's just for fun.

Click on the links below to go the Scripting Games category on each of these guys blog:

<a href="http://p0w3rsh3ll.wordpress.com/tag/psh2013/" target="_blank">_Emin_</a> also known as p0w3rsh3ll (I've been impressed with his PowerShell scripting abilities ever since he wrote some functions to set the proxy server settings on Server core - <a href="http://p0w3rsh3ll.wordpress.com/2012/10/07/getsetclear-proxy/" target="_blank">see that article here</a>).

If there's anyone else blogging about the Scripting Games, leave a comment and I'll post a link to your blog as well. I believe PowerShell.org is in the process of putting something similar to this up.

Here's where you can find <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/category/scripting-games/" target="_blank">the blog articles</a> that I've written about the Scripting Games.

<strong>Update:</strong> More blogs about the 2013 Scripting Games will be added to the list below as I'm made aware of them. This is an open invitation to have the "2013 Scripting Games" category of your blog listed here:

<a href="http://powershellreflections.wordpress.com/category/scripting-games-2013/" target="_blank">Jonathan Tyler</a> is one of the top PowerShell scripters in the advanced competition this year. He won the Iron Scripter competition last year at PowerShell Saturday 002 in Charlotte, NC.
