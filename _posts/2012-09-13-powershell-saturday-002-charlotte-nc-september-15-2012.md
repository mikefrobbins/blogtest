If you haven't heard, there's a <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/002/" target="_blank">PowerShell Saturday</a> technology event this weekend in Charlotte, NC (Saturday, September 15, 2012). It's going to be awesome based on the list of <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/002/presentations/" target="_blank">sessions</a> and <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/002/speakers/" target="_blank">speakers</a> they have lined up which rivals conferences that cost <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/002/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5349" title="pssat002" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/pssat002.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="150" /></a>hundreds or possibly even thousands of dollars to attend. It's also similar to the SQL and SharePoint Saturday technology events that I've attended for the past few years so I can speak from experience, they're definitely worth the time and effort to attend. They're even giving away two Xbox's to two lucky attendee's. Have I said that attending is a no brainer if you have any interest what so ever in PowerShell, advancing your career, and networking with other PowerShell enthusiast? I'm personally burning a day of vacation and driving 530 miles one way to Charlotte to attend:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/pssat002map.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" title="pssat002map" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/pssat002map.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="201" /></a>

There are only a few tickets left at this point so <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/002/register/" target="_blank">sign up</a> quickly if you're interested! Here's a phrase I've used before and it's fitting in this scenario "<strong>PowerShell: Learn it, love it, and want more of it.</strong>"

For anyone who is going to be in the car for a while like me, there's a cool <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadPodcastsWithPowershell.aspx" target="_blank">PowerShell script on Scott Hanselman's blog</a> that can be used to download all the PowerScripting Podcast episodes by substituting "http://feeds.feedburner.com/PowerScripting" for the URL that's in his code. That will give you plenty to listen to on the trip to and from the event.

By the way, speaking of the <a href="http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/up-next-jason-helmick-on-the-2013-powershell-summit-and-his-upcoming-iis-book/" target="_blank">PowerScripting Podcast, Jason Helmick</a> will be the guest speaker tonight at 9:30pm EDT. He will be talking about the <a href="http://www.powershellsummit.org/" target="_blank">2013 PowerShell Summit</a> and his upcoming <a href="http://www.manning.com/helmick/" target="_blank">Learn Windows IIS in a Month of Lunches</a> book! I met Jason at Microsoft TechEd this year and I was very impressed so I've been looking forward to this episode.
