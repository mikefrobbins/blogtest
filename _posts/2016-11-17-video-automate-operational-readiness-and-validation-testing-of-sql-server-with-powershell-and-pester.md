I recently presented a session on "Automate Operational Readiness and Validation Testing of SQL Server with PowerShell and Pester" for the <a href="http://powershell.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PowerShell Virtual Chapter of SQL PASS</a>.

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds1YO_Dpx0I" target="_blank">video</a> from that presentation is now available:
