If you're interested in a free day of PowerShell training, there are numerous sessions on different topics in the dedicated PowerShell track at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/628/EventHome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQL Saturday #628</a> in Baton Rouge, Louisiana this Saturday, July 29th. I'll be presenting a session on how to "<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/628/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=64732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automate Operational Readiness and Validation Testing of SQL Server with PowerShell and Pester</a>".

Here’s a little information about what you can expect from my session:

<strong>Automate Operational Readiness and Validation Testing of SQL Server with PowerShell and Pester</strong>
<em>How do you know whether or not all of the SQL Servers in your environment are configured based on your organizations standards? How do you know whether or not they are all operating properly when maintenance is performed on the systems in your environment? During this session, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will discuss and demonstrate how to use PowerShell and Pester to automate operational readiness and operational validation testing of your SQL Servers and the systems in your environment that depend on them. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.</em>

My session begins at 2:45pm in room 1835 in the LSU College of Business building. The address is Louisiana State University, Business Education Complex, Nicholson Drive Extension, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 (USA). Be sure to check <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/628/Sessions/Schedule.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the event schedule</a> for any changes to the schedule or location.

The PowerShell code used during my demonstrations and the slide deck from my session will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.

I hope to see you there!
