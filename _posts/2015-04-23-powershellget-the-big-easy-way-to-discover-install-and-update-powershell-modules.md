On Tuesday of this week, I presented a session at the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america-2015/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit North America 2015</a> with the same title as this blog article. The video of my session is now available on PowerShell.org's YouTube channel:
