This blog article is the first guest post ever on this site. When I'm approached by someone who wants to write a guest blog article, I suggest that they should start their own blog. If they're simply not interested in that, I put them in contact with <a href="https://powershell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell.org</a> because it seems like a more appropriate place to publish community blog articles. The majority of the posts on this site are simply the steps of how I've done something in a real-world production environment. I document the process here for both my future self and for others. I can't tell you how many times I've searched for something on the Internet and my own blog site is returned as one of the results.

In the same spirit of helping others, today's guest post is from fellow Microsoft MVP <a href="https://twitter.com/adbertram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Bertram</a>. This article is to help Adam, potential TechSnips contributors, and everyone else who learns from the videos on TechSnips.

Take it away Adam...

<em>My name is Adam Bertram and Mike has so graciously allowed me to guest post on his blog about a new service I've started that offers free, how-to content for tech professionals. OK, here's the pitch:</em>

<em>We're geeks, right? We love tinkering with tech and figuring out better ways to solve problems. How cool would it be if lots of us could come together under one platform and share our hard-earned knowledge with everyone else via technical demo screencasts? I'm glad you asked!</em>

<em>I recently launched an e-learning platform called <a href="https://www.techsnips.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechSnips</a>. First and foremost, TechSnips is not a Pluralsight, Udemy or LinkedIn Learning. We don't do courses; we do snips. Snips are short (1-10) minute screencasts with absolutely no slides of any kind. Its purpose is to deliver exactly what IT pros, system administrators and other technology professionals need right now. We skip over all of the fluff.</em>

<em>Because of this short format, it's a lot easier to get started contributing if you're new to putting yourself out there in the tech community. You will learn presentation skills through feedback from myself and your peers, you'll be a member of our growing community and get access to our Slack channel, you'll have some great content to put on your resume and you will get paid in monthly royalties! Joining has a ton of upsides but you've got to be willing to put yourself out there.</em>

<em>I'm looking for contributors that can help myself and the dozens of other contributors build the TechSnips content library. As of now, we need to fill a lot of holes so the types of screencasts will most likely be up to you. As long the content fits in the snip format (which you'll get more info in the signup link), the world is your oyster. FYI: We need lots of PowerShell stuff!</em>

<em>If you're interested, please <a href="https://www.techsnips.io/en/join-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up</a>! You'll be asked to do a quick audition and once approved, you'll be part of the TechSnips Contributor community!</em>

<em>I look forward to seeing what new content you can come up with and how teaching others can help yours and others' IT careers flourish!</em>
