Tonight from 8:30pm to 10pm Central Time I'll be presenting at the first ever <a href="http://mspsug.com/" target="_blank">Mississippi PowerShell Users Group</a> online (virtual) meeting. The topic for my presentation is "<a href="http://mspsug.com/2013/03/03/mspsug-march-12th-meeting-parsing-the-event-logs-of-windows-based-systems-with-powershell/" target="_blank">Parsing the Event Logs of Windows Based Systems with PowerShell</a>".

We'll start out with a basic overview via a few PowerPoint slides:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/parsing-eventlogs.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6918" alt="parsing-eventlogs" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/parsing-eventlogs.png" width="618" height="464" /></a>Next and for the majority of the meeting, I'll be demonstrating how to parse the event logs using PowerShell. This will include how to figure out what cmdlets can be used to parse the event logs, demonstrating each parameter set of those cmdlets, using WMI, the new CIM cmdlets, and finally using the .NET Framework to parse the event logs.

At some random point during the meeting , we'll be giving away two ebook copies of the <a href="http://www.manning.com/hicks/" target="_blank">PowerShell Deep Dives book</a> to two random attendees using the <em>Get-Random</em> cmdlet to determine the winners. We also have an exclusive discount code for all books at <a href="http://manning.com/" target="_blank">Manning.com</a> to publish during the meeting (just in case you don't win).

<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5638643334?ref=ebtnebregn" target="_blank">Sign up now</a> to receive the URL and be sure to <a href="http://mspsug.com/attendee-info/" target="_blank">install the Lync attendee client</a> ahead of time if you don't already have Microsoft Lync or the Lync attendee client installed.
