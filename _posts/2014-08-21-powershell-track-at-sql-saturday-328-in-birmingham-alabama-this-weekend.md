Do you work with technology and live within driving distance of Birmingham Alabama? Then you should consider attending <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/328/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #328</a> this weekend. There’s an entire track dedicated to PowerShell and while a few of the sessions in that particular track will focus on SQL Server, there's also a session on PowerShell Fundamentals for SharePoint, a session on Stupid PowerShell Tricks by PowerShell MVP Jim Christopher, and a session on the new features in PowerShell version 5 that I’ll be presenting.

I'll also be presenting one of the PowerShell sessions that focuses on SQL Server (Learn PowerShell or Die! for the DBA) where I'll demonstrate using PowerShell to work with SQL Server 2005 through 2014. I've added some new content to this particular session that is sure to raise some eyebrows. Did I mention there will be swag?
