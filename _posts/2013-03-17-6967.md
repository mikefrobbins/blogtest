<a href="http://mspsug.com/2013/03/09/using-a-powershell-quote-list-function-to-work-with-an-array-of-strings/" target="_blank">Reblogged from Mississippi PowerShell User Group:</a>

Recently, during one of our test user group meetings that Rohn and I had, I was using an example of storing multiple server names into an array to then work with them. This is how I would normally accomplish this task, that is unless I pulled the names directly from Active Directory:
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">$servers = 'server1', 'server2', 'server3', 'server4', 'server5', 'server6'
$servers</pre>
<img alt="ql1" src="http://mspsug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ql1.png" width="530" height="106" />

Rohn showed me the way he has been accomplishing this sort of task which requires less typing:
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">$servers = 'server1,server2,server3,server4,server5,server6' -split ','
$servers</pre>
<a href="http://mspsug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ql2.png"><img alt="ql2" src="http://mspsug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ql2.png" width="530" height="109" /></a>

I tweaked Rohn's example a little since I prefer to split on spaces, but it's basically the same example:
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">$servers = 'server1 server2 server3 server4 server5 server6' -split ' '
$servers</pre>
<img alt="ql3" src="http://mspsug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ql3.png" width="530" height="109" />

With further testing, I determined I could use the split parameter first and save a few more characters even though the tabbed expansion or intellisense in the ISE didn't like this, it still worked:
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">$servers = -split 'server1 server2 server3 server4 server5 server6'
$servers</pre>
<img alt="ql4" src="http://mspsug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ql4.png" width="530" height="114" />

Rohn said he recently learned about using a function called a quote list where you can define the function and then simply pass your items to it with no punctuation required:
<pre class="lang:ps decode:true">function ql{$args}
$servers = ql server1 server2 server3 server4 server5 server6
$servers</pre>

I decided to record a short video of this process:

Update:
I asked Rohn to take a look at this post and see what he thought. He said he learned about the quote list function while reading the "<a href="http://www.manning.com/payette2/" target="_blank">Windows PowerShell in Action, Second Edition</a>" book written by Bruce Payette.
