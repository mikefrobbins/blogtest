I'll be presenting a webinar on how to "<a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8364069990841332993" target="_blank">Automate Operational Readiness and Validation Testing of SQL Server with PowerShell and Pester</a>" for the <a href="http://powershell.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PowerShell Virtual Chapter of SQL PASS</a> on Wednesday, November 16th at 11am CST.

<a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8364069990841332993" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14704" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/psvcsqlpass111616.png" alt="psvcsqlpass111616" width="859" height="645" /></a>

How do you know whether or not all of the SQL Servers in your environment are configured based on your organizations standards? How do you know whether or not they are all operating properly when maintenance is performed on the systems in your environment? During this session, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will discuss and demonstrate how to use PowerShell and Pester to automate operational readiness and operational validation testing of your SQL Servers and the systems in your environment that depend on them. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.

Both the slide deck and code for this presentation will be posted in <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank">my Presentations Repository on GitHub</a> shortly before the session begins.
