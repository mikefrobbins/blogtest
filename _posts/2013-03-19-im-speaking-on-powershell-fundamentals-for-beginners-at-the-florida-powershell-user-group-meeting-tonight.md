<span style="line-height:1.5;">Tonight, Tuesday March 19th, at 7pm eastern time, I'll be presenting a session titled "PowerShell Fundamentals for Beginners" at the </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://flpsug.com/" target="_blank">Florida PowerShell User Group</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> meeting:</span>

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ps-fundamentals1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6983" alt="ps-fundamentals1" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ps-fundamentals1.png?w=640" width="640" height="457" /></a><span style="line-height:1.5;">During this presentation, I'll be covering the concepts that were difficult for me to learn when I first started using PowerShell. </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">We'll start out by discussing where to find PowerShell, how to launch it along with issues you'll experience when running the shell as a non-admin as well as execution policy related issues. Then we'll work our way through the </span><em style="color:#444444;line-height:1.5;">Get-Help</em><span style="line-height:1.5;">, </span><em style="color:#444444;line-height:1.5;">Get-Command</em><span style="line-height:1.5;">, and </span><em style="color:#444444;line-height:1.5;">Get-Member</em><span style="line-height:1.5;"> cmdlets. Did you know that both the <em>Get-Help</em> and <em>Get-Command</em> cmdlets had new parameters added to them in PowerShell version 3 that are extremely useful and beneficial to both new users and guru's?</span>
