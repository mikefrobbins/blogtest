Learning <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell</a> seems to be a hot topic for the new year. <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My PowerShell 101 book</a> was the number one bestseller on Leanpub earlier this week and now it's the featured book on their website.

Going to <a href="https://leanpub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the homepage on their website</a>, shows the book is indeed the currently featured one.

I would also like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/thetommymaynard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tommy Maynard</a> for the technical editing he performed on the book. If you're not <a href="https://twitter.com/thetommymaynard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following him on Twitter</a> or reading the articles on <a href="http://tommymaynard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog site</a>, you should be.
