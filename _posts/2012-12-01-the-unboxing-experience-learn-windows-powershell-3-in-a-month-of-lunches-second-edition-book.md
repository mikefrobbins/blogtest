When I arrived at home after work yesterday, I found a surprise box on my desk:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book1/" rel="attachment wp-att-6152"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6152" alt="ps3-book1" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book1.jpg" width="640" height="498" /></a>

A quick look at the label on the side of the box gave away its secret contents. It was my new, hot off the press, copy of "<a href="http://www.manning.com/jones3/" target="_blank">Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches, Second Edition</a>" book written by Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks, published by <a href="http://manning.com/" target="_blank">Manning</a>:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6153"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6153" alt="ps3-book2" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book2.jpg" width="640" height="341" /></a>

I have to say that it was packed very well for a book. I recently received another package from a different vendor that contained a fragile item that wasn't packaged nearly this well:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book3/" rel="attachment wp-att-6154"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6154" alt="ps3-book3" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book3.jpg" width="640" height="499" /></a>

This picture honestly doesn't do the book justice because of the glare from the flash. After removing the packing material, I found my new book just underneath the receipt which has also been removed from the box (I didn't even have to wait until Christmas).

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book4/" rel="attachment wp-att-6155"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6155" alt="ps3-book4" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book4.jpg" width="467" height="600" /></a>

In person, without the glare from the camera flash, the book looks like a masterpiece:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book5/" rel="attachment wp-att-6156"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6156" alt="ps3-book5" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book5.jpg" width="640" height="761" /></a>

I was even able to get the book to stand up on edge and this is a softbound book:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book7/" rel="attachment wp-att-6158"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6158" alt="ps3-book7" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book7.jpg" width="640" height="93" /></a>

I also own the previous version of the book which has been well used, although you wouldn't know it based on its condition as shown in the following image along with the new book. The previous version has held up well considering the amount of use its seen:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book8/" rel="attachment wp-att-6159"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6159" alt="ps3-book8" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book8.jpg" width="640" height="420" /></a>

The new version is about 10% longer (more pages) than the previous edition which makes it slightly thicker:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book9/" rel="attachment wp-att-6160"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6160" alt="ps3-book9" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book9.jpg" width="640" height="151" /></a>

One of the things I like is the voucher in the book to receive an eBook copy of it so I can have the best of both worlds (a printed copy and an electronic copy):

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2012/12/01/the-unboxing-experience-learn-windows-powershell-3-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition-book/ps3-book10/" rel="attachment wp-att-6163"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6163" alt="ps3-book10" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ps3-book10.jpg" width="444" height="600" /></a>

This <a href="http://www.manning.com/jones3/" target="_blank">book</a> would make a great Christmas present for an IT pro or developer!
