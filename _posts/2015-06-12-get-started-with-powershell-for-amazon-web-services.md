I recently had a guest blog article published on the Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog site on how to "<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2015/05/16/weekend-scripter-get-started-with-powershell-for-amazon-web-services.aspx" target="_blank">Get-Started with PowerShell for Amazon Web Services</a>".

As referenced in that blog article, the custom PowerShell script module that I wrote for managing AWS storage gateway snapshots can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/AWS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

If you found that guest blog article interesting, I have another blog article that I've written on "<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2015/04/09/filtering-by-starttime-with-the-aws-powershell-cmdlets/" target="_blank">Filtering by StartTime with the AWS PowerShell Cmdlets</a>" that you might also be interested in reading.
