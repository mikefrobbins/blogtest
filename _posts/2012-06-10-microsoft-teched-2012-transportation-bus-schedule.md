Here's the Microsoft TechEd North America 2012 Transportation (Bus) Schedule as posted in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying at. Click on the image for a zoomed-in view:

Here's a challenge for anyone who views this. There's a small amount of the lobby of the hotel shown in the image above. Can anyone guess what hotel I'm staying at?

Here's where you can <a href="http://msft.it/6017rgvB" target="_blank">download a PDF </a>of this schedule.
