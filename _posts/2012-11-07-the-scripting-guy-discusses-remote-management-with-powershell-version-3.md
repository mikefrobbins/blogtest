The Scripting Guy (Ed Wilson) will be presenting at the <a href="http://www.azposh.com/" target="_blank">Arizona PowerShell Users Group</a> today, Wednesday November 7th from 3:30 to 5pm MST (Mountain Standard Time).

If you can't be there in person, here's a <a href="http://www.azposh.com/2012/10/next-week-the-scripting-guy-discussions-remote-management-with-psv3/" target="_blank">link to the Arizona PowerShell Users Group page</a> where the information to join the Lync online meeting is posted. I attended last month's online meeting and you'll want the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23396" target="_blank">Microsoft Lync 2010 Attendee fat client</a> (not the web client). The fat client is the only way I found to hear the audio during the online meeting. The web client doesn't allow you to hear the audio. From what I found, the fat client installs and runs without issue on Windows 8 even though it's not listed as being officially supported. There's a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15755" target="_blank">user level install</a> if you're not an admin on your computer.
