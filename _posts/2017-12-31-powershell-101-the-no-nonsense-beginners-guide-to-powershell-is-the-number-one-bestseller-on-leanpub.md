I would like to thank everyone who helped make my new book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a>, the number one bestseller on <a href="https://leanpub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leanpub.com</a>.

As shown in the previous image, PowerShell 101 is the number one top book on their homepage. It's also the number one bestseller on their site in the last week:

<a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16039" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/best-seller2b.jpg" alt="" width="859" height="363" /></a>And the book with the most copies sold in the last week:

<a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16040" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/best-seller3a.jpg" alt="" width="859" height="388" /></a>

Today is the last day to purchase the book using <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101/c/ZHf6zIL1Y668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the special year's end promotion</a>, but as always with Leanpub.com, you can pay more. All of the proceeds from this book help keep this blog site online and support my community activities as well as helping to fund any cost associated with running the <a href="http://mspsug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi PowerShell User Group</a>.
