This past Tuesday, I presented a session on "<a href="http://powershell.org/wp/event/omaha-powershell-user-group-october-meeting/" target="_blank">Using PowerShell Desired State Configuration in your On-Premises Datacenter</a>" for the <a href="http://twitter.com/OmahaPSUG" target="_blank">Omaha PowerShell User Group</a>. During that presentation I demonstrated a number of the tips and tricks that I've learned while implementing systems in multiple data-centers using DSC.

The meeting was recorded and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfth5xUlYLM" target="_blank">video</a> from it is now available:<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/omaha-dsc1a.jpg">
