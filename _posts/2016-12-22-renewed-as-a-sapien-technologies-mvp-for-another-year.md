<a href="https://www.sapien.com/company/mvp/10/Mike_Robbins"><img class="alignleft wp-image-14842 size-full" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sapien-mvp2017.png" width="135" height="244" /></a>I received notification earlier this week that I've been renewed for another year (2017) as a SAPIEN Technologies MVP. I'm honored to be associated with SAPIEN Technologies since much of their focus is on PowerShell tools. If you're not familiar with their products, take a look at them on <a href="https://www.sapien.com/" target="_blank">their website</a>. They offer a 45 day evaluation for each of their products so you can try them out before you buy them. They also have forums where you can find assistance with not only their products but general PowerShell questions as well. If you're looking for assistance with their products, that's definitely the best place to post your questions.

Keep an eye on this blog site where I'll be periodically posting tips that I've learned about their products throughout the year.
