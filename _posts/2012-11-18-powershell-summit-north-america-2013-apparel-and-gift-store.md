I thought I would share the "unboxing experience" of my PowerShell Summit North America 2013 T-Shirt.

The T-Shirt arrived in about a week with the economy shipping choice. It arrived in a mail type bag as shown below. The shirt was folded and had what I would call a brown paper ribbon around it with a cafe press sticker and a thank you card with my receipt in it:

The color I chose was charcoal. The size is an X-Large which is what I normally purchase. No complaints about the size or color, both are as expected. The shirt has been washed:

You'll find <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/powershellsummit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the PowerShell Summit North America 2013 Apparel &amp; Gift Store at CafePress</a> if you're interested in purchasing an item with this cool PowerShell Summit logo on it:

Speaking of the <a href="http://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell Summit North America 2013</a>, do you have your ticket yet? As of this writing, there are only 11 tickets left. I personally fronted the money for my ticket:
