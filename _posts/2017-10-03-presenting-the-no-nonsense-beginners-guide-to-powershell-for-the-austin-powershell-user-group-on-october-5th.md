If you’re interested in some free PowerShell training where you’ll learn the basics of PowerShell from a best practices standpoint, I’ll be presenting a session on “<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Austin-PowerShell/events/243482241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a>” for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Austin-PowerShell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austin PowerShell User Group</a> this Thursday, October 5th. The presentation begins at 6pm central time and is a beginner level session.

Here’s a little information about what you can expect from the presentation:

<em>Interested in PowerShell but not sure how to get started? Already have some experience but still having trouble with the basic concepts? This session is for you! Learn to easily figure out what the commands are and how to use those commands without searching the Internet. Extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server. During this presentation, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate several of the core PowerShell cmdlets along with writing one-liners and basics scripts. We’ll discuss how to prevent resume generating events when making changes with PowerShell. Learn what objects, properties, and methods are along with how they’re used in PowerShell. Not a developer? PowerShell is one of those technologies that you can be extremely effective with whether you’re a developer or an IT Pro.</em>
