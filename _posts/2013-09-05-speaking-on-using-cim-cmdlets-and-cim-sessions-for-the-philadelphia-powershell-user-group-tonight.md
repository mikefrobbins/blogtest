Years ago, needing something as simple as the serial number from a remote server often meant that administrators had to resort to making a trip to the remote location. Even back in those days, some administrators were savvy enough to query WMI with third party programs or scripting languages such as VBScript to retrieve this information. Although, querying WMI was kind of like black magic back in those days and it was often simply easier to travel to the remote site or spend the money to purchase a third party product that could make retrieving this type of information easier for an average administrator.

Now there’s PowerShell. PowerShell empowers an average skill-set administrator to be able to retrieve this type of information and just about anything else they want to know about their servers by querying WMI, and best of all, PowerShell is free and pre-installed on all modern versions of Windows. During this session, we’ll compare the differences in the legacy WMI cmdlets and the new CIM cmdlets.

We’ll discuss the methods that were available for querying WMI with PowerShell version 2, along with some of the obstacles you’re likely to encounter when trying to retrieve information from WMI on remote servers when using PowerShell version 2. Then we’ll move onto demonstrating how much easier and efficient the CIM cmdlets in PowerShell version 3 have made querying WMI. Anyone who followed me and my scripts during this year’s scripting games knows that I I’m a big fan of the CIM cmdlets.
