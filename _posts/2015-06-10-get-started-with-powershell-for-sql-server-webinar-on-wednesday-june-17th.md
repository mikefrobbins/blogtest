Know of anyone who is interested in PowerShell but not sure how to Get-Started? Next Wednesday, June 17th (One week from today), I'll be presenting a session on how to "Get-Started with PowerShell for SQL Server" for the <a href="http://powershell.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PowerShell Virtual Chapter of PASS</a>:
