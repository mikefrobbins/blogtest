Late last night I received an email about a session being cancelled at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/628/EventHome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQL Saturday #628 in Baton Rouge</a> which is scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday, July 29th. I'll be presenting my <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/628/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=64729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a> session in that time slot which is the first session of the day in the PowerShell track, beginning at 9:15am.

<a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/628/EventHome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7765" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sqlsatbr.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="820" /></a>

I've presented this session a couple of times this year at other events and I've tweaked it each time based on the feedback I've received. Since presenting it two weeks ago in Atlanta, I discovered that some of the information has changed when it comes to PowerShell with the most recent versions of SQL Server Management Studio (version 17+) which means you'll be receiving the most up to date information possible during this presentation. Keep in mind, this is an entry level beginner session. There’s also an entire days worth of PowerShell sessions being presented by other Microsoft MVP's and/or experts in the industry in the same room (room 1835).

Here’s a little information about what you can expect from this session:

<strong>PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</strong>
<em>Interested in PowerShell but not sure how to get started? Already have some experience but still having trouble with the basic concepts? This session is for you! Learn to easily figure out what the commands are and how to use those commands without searching the Internet. Extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server. During this presentation, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate several of the core PowerShell cmdlets along with writing one-liners and basics scripts. We’ll discuss how to prevent resume generating events when making changes with PowerShell. Learn what objects, properties, and methods are along with how they’re used in PowerShell. Not a developer? PowerShell is one of those technologies that you can be extremely effective with whether you’re a developer or an IT Pro.</em>

I recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBEqHwmM-z8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> of one of the demonstrations that I be presenting during this session. Be sure to see <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2017/07/14/copy-databases-from-5-different-sql-servers-in-100-seconds-with-the-dbatools-powershell-module/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the associated blog article</a> that explains this video.
