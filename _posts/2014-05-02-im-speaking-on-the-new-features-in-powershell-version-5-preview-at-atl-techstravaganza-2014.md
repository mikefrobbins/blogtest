I've been home for a couple of hours now from the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/" target="_blank">PowerShell Summit North America 2014</a> which was in the Seattle Washington area earlier this week and my brain is about to
explode from all of the PowerShell awesomeness that I learned about. There will be many blog articles to follow on those subjects, but I wanted to let my readers know that I'll be
speaking at the <a href="http://www.atltechstravaganza.com/" target="_blank">ATL TechStravaganza 2014</a> in Atlanta Georgia on Friday, June 6th. My topic? PowerShell of Course. Specifically, the new features in the preview version of PowerShell version 5 which is part of the Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview.

I'll be demonstrating the new OneGet module and if you don't know what that is you should check out <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/tag/oneget/" target="_blank">my blog articles about it</a>. I'll also briefly cover the new NetworkSwitch cmdlets as well as some of the other minor changes to various aspects of PowerShell that I've found in the version 5 preview.

So what does the PowerShell Summit have to do with all of this? The simple fact is that not everyone can attend conferences like the PowerShell Summit, but the good news is that
people like me believe in sharing what they learn at conferences. I picked up some additional information about the new features in the PowerShell version 5 preview while at the PowerShell Summit this week and I'll be adding that information to my presentation.

I'll also be attending <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft TechEd</a> in Houston the week of May 12th (as the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/2013/06/11/overall-winners-of-the-scripting-games/" target="_blank">Winner of the Advanced Category in the 2013 Scripting Games</a>). That conference is sold out and from what I've heard there will be some announcements made about PowerShell at that conference as well. You know what that means? If it's PowerShell version 5 related, there
will be even more information for me to share with you during my presentation at ATL
TechStravaganza 2014. If I end up with too much information, I'll have to cut out some of the cool stuff and only share the really cool stuff as I don't want to overwhelm you either.
