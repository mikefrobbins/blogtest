Prior to implementing Exchange Server 2010, check with your current Antivirus vendor to validate their product is supported on Exchange 2010. The messaging agent component of Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Advanced 6.0 will not install and is not supported on a server running Exchange 2010. WFBS Advanced 7.0 will fully support Exchange 2010 and is scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter of 2010. Trend Micro is current providing their WFBS Advanced customers with a temporary license for their SMEX 10.0 product as a temporary workaround until WFBS Advanced 7.0 is released. See Solution ID “<a href="http://esupport.trendmicro.com/Pages/Does-Worry-Free-Business-Security-Advanced-support-Microsoft-Exchange-Server-2010-.aspx" target="_blank">EN-1055207</a>” on the Trend Micro website for more information that is specific to their WFBS Advanced product support on Exchange 2010.
