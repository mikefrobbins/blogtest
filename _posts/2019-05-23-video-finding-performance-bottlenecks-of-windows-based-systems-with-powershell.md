<p style="text-align: left;">Earlier this month, I presented a session on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHZOffoZyE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finding Performance Bottlenecks with PowerShell</a> at the <a href="https://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2019</a> in Bellevue, Washington. The session seemed to be well received by the audience based on the feedback that I received from the attendees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHZOffoZyE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> from this presentation is now available</p>
