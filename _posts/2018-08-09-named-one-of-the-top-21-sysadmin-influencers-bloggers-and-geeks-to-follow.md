I was recently named as one of the top <a href="https://itchronicles.com/operations/21-sysadmin-influencers-bloggers-geeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 SysAdmin influencers, bloggers, and geeks to follow</a> on this years' SysAdmin Day by IT Chronicles.

I'm humbled and honored to be part of their list. There are also several other Microsoft Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP's for Windows PowerShell on the list. If your interested in PowerShell (and you probably are if you're reading this blog site), I'd recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://itchronicles.com/operations/21-sysadmin-influencers-bloggers-geeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original article on the IT Chronicles website</a>.
