I'll be speaking this Saturday, October 27th at <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/003/" target="_blank">PowerShell Saturday 003</a> in Atlanta. My session is officially titled "PowerShell Fundamentals for Beginners". A <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/10/25/powershell-fundamentals-for-beginners.aspx" target="_blank">guest blog</a> that I wrote about PowerShell, my session, and the event was published yesterday on the Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog at Microsoft TechNet so take a look at it and the <a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/003/presentation/powershell-fundamentals-for-beginners/" target="_blank">brief description of my session</a> on the PowerShell Saturday 003 website for more details.

It's getting close to Halloween so I picked up some special treats in the New Orleans area this week to give out during my session to people who answer questions:
