This week while working with some PowerShell scripts that retrieve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation" target="_blank">WMI</a> information from remote servers, I ran into an issue where I was able to return results from Windows 2008 R2 servers without issue but was unable to return results from Windows 2008 (non-R2) servers even though they had PowerShell 2.0 installed and as far as I could tell they were configured exactly the same as the Windows 2008 R2 servers.

Here's the error I received:

<em><span style="color:#ff0000;">Get-WmiObject : The RPC server is unavailable. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706BA)</span></em>
<em><span style="color:#ff0000;">At D:Get-MachineInfo.ps1:18 char:14</span></em>

Enabling "Remote Administration" in the firewall on the Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) servers resolved this issue.

I verified this firewall exception was not allowed on the Windows 2008 R2 servers since those worked without issue, but it does appear that it's required on the non-R2 servers.
