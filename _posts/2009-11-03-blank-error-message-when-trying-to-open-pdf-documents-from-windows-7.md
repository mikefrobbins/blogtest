Problem:
When attempting to open a pdf document by clicking on a hyperlink from within Windows 7, you receive a blank error message with Adobe Reader in the title and a question mark for the error message. Clicking on the OK button only displays a blank web page and does not open the pdf document.

Solution:
Installing all the available updates from the Adobe Reader 9 help menu &gt; check for updates sub-menu option appears to resolve this issue.
