Another update to my new book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank">PowerShell 101: The No-Nonsense Beginner’s Guide to PowerShell</a> is now available. The update which was published this morning added chapter 3 to the already available first two chapters.

<a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell101" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14969" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/powershell101-150x194.png" alt="" width="150" height="194" /></a>If you're interested in purchasing this book, consider buying it while it's still a work in progress. The price of the book increases slightly with each chapter that's released.

Chapter 1 of the book is available as a free sample download. There's also a <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2017/02/02/video-powershell-101-the-no-nonsense-beginners-guide-to-powershell/" target="_blank">video</a> available which demonstrates the topics covered in chapter 1.

I'll be presenting a session that's based on the content contained in the book at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/593/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday Birmingham</a> on Saturday, March 18th.

More information about the PowerShell 101 book can be found in <a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2017/01/26/announcing-a-new-book-powershell-101-the-no-nonsense-beginners-guide-to-powershell/" target="_blank">my blog article where I announced the book</a>.

I was honored to see that fellow Microsoft MVP, Carlo Mancini, recently published a blog article on "<a href="http://www.happysysadm.com/2017/02/ramp-up-your-powershell-knowledge-in.html" target="_blank">Ramp up your PowerShell knowledge in 2017 with these books</a>" which recommended my PowerShell 101 book. His recommendation was unsolicited. Thank you Carlo!
