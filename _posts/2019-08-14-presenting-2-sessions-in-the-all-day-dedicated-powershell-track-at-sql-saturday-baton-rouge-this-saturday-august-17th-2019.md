Here’s a little information about what you can expect from my sessions:

<strong>PowerShell + SQL Server = Better Together</strong>
<em>As a SQL Server professional, are you able to make a rhyme or reason to this thing called PowerShell? Need to accomplish something? Do you use Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core? How will you interface with PowerShell? With the PowerShell console, ISE, VSCode, SAPIEN PowerShell Studio, or something else? Will you use Cmdlets from one of the various SQL related PowerShell modules? If so, which one? SQLPS, SQLServer, DBATools, etc. Or maybe you should use the SQL PS provider? What about SMO? Or write your own custom .NET code that can be executed with PowerShell? With it being so difficult to determine how to go about running something in PowerShell, it’s no wonder that most people resort to searching the Internet to figure it out. The sad thing is that most of the PowerShell code you’ll find on the Internet is less than optimal to say the least. I’ll demonstrate how and when to use different approaches along with adhering to the community’s best practices for writing PowerShell code.</em>

<strong>Writing Award Winning PowerShell Functions and Script Modules</strong>
<em>Transitioning from writing PowerShell one-liners and basic scripts to creating reusable PowerShell tools with advanced functions and script modules can be a daunting task and with all the different ways that you’ll find on the Internet to accomplish the same task, it can definitely seem overwhelming. During this session, I’ll demystify many of the intricacies of toolmaking while demonstrating the best practices for using parameters, parameter validation, cmdlet binding, supports should process, pipeline input, error handling, module manifests, and custom formatting.</em>

My first presentation begins at 9:15am and my second one begins at 12:15pm, both in room 1305 of the new LSU College of Business building, Louisiana State University Business Education Complex, 501 South Quad Drive (Formerly 4005 Nicholson Drive Extension), Baton Rouge, LA 70808.

The PowerShell code used during my demonstrations and the slide deck from my session will be uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/mikefrobbins/Presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my presentations repository on GitHub</a>.

I hope to see you there!
