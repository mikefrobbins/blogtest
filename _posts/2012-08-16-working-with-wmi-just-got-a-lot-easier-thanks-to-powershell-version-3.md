Working with WMI just got a lot easier thanks to the new tabbed expansion feature of the <em>Get-CimInstance</em> cmdlet in PowerShell version 3 that makes discovering namespaces and classes a much simpler process.

Let me know what you think and if you would like to see more of these types of videos.
