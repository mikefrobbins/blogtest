There are only two months left until the <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell Summit North America 2014</a>. The tickets for the 2013 PowerShell Summit sold out before the end of 2012 and a lot of people missed out on an awesome opportunity because they didn't act quickly enough. Well, this year they've expanded the capacity by moving it to a different location in Seattle and the tickets were sold in stages. So what are you waiting for? If you're planning to attend, you better hurry up and purchase your ticket before you miss out on an awesome potentially career changing opportunity like this again!

I hadn't previous been to Seattle before last year. Here's the view from the <a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Needle</a>:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/022714-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9234" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/022714-3.jpg" alt="022714-3" width="1024" height="594" /></a>

If you have an interest in PowerShell (if you care about your career as an IT Pro, you should) then you should definitely consider attending. In most cases, the cost of the whole enchilada (ticket, airfare, hotel, etc) to attend the PowerShell Summit is less than the cost of just the ticket for admission to other conferences let alone all the other related expenses.

Here's a picture of the space needle that I previously referenced:

<a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/022714-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9236" src="http://mikefrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/022714-4.jpg" alt="022714-4" width="1024" height="1365" /></a>

You'll also have a chance to network with others who are just like you and who are either facing or have faced the same challenges you're facing. This will allow you to grow your network of contacts that you can reach out to for assistance and it has been my experience that this alone will save you a lot more time than the amount of time you'll spend at the Summit (It's a great return on investment as far as time goes as well as money).

Both of the guys who are in this picture with me (Brian Wilhite and Jason Walker) are Microsoft PFE's and both of them will be speaking at the PowerShell Summit this year:

If you've read this blog article up to this point, then you know you want to attend so head on over to <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell.org</a> and register before all of the tickets are gone!

You might even have a chance to see some cool stuff in airports during your journey to and from the PowerShell Summit:

The sessions at the PowerShell Summit aren't recorded, but if you would like an idea of what type of content was covered last year, there were some <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/2013/05/07/powershell-summit-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unofficial recordings</a>. You'll also find the agenda for this year on <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell.org</a>. Once you're registered, grab a copy of this badge and show support on your blog:

I look forward to seeing you at the Summit this year.
