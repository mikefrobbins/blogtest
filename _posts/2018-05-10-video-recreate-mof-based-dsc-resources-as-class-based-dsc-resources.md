Last month I presented a session on how to <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cqc9/recreate-mof-based-dsc-resources-as-class-based-dsc-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recreate MOF based DSC resources as Class based DSC resources</a> at the <a href="https://powershell.org/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit</a> in Seattle, Washington. The session seemed to be well received by the audience based on the feedback that I received from the attendees.

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeO_9KDB958&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> from this presentation is now available.
