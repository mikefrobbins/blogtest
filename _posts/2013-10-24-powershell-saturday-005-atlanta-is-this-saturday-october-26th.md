Don't miss out on an awesome opportunity to attend a PowerShell Saturday technology event this weekend in Atlanta where you'll be able to learn some PowerShell from Microsoft MVP's, PowerShell enthusiasts, and product evangelists as well as being able to meet face to face and network with other IT pro's in the industry!

I'm scheduled to present two sessions, one on "<a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/005/presentation/powershell-best-practices-and-lessons-learned-from-the-2013-scripting-games/" target="_blank">PowerShell Best Practices and Lessons Learned from the 2013 Scripting Games</a>", and another on "<a href="http://powershellsaturday.com/005/presentation/gui-toolmaking-with-powershell/" target="_blank">GUI Toolmaking with PowerShell</a>". There are over a dozen awesome speakers scheduled to present a total of fifteen sessions in three different tracks so even if you feel the way this guy does who is following me on twitter, there's a PowerShell track for you:

There will be an Iron Scripter competition similar to a mini-scripting games - no worries though, I won't be competing although I may be performing some duties related to this.

I've also been given the all clear to announce a couple of things during my sessions, one of which won't be announced to the general public until Monday and the other is something that I'll be briefly demonstrating that only a couple of other people are aware of. Very cool stuff and both are PowerShell related.
