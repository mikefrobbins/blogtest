I recently discovered a rendering problem in VS Code where pressing escape doesn't delete a multi-line command in the PowerShell integrated terminal. I created a <a href="https://youtu.be/0dySuC0RV4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> to report the problem and I thought I would share it here since the quality was less than optimal when sharing it on Twitter.
